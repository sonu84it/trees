# trees

This repository now contains a small interactive visualizer for binary trees.
Open `index.html` in a web browser to see a sample binary tree and animate its
traversals. The controls at the top provide buttons for starting preorder,
inorder, or postorder traversal. Each node is highlighted in sequence as the chosen
traversal progresses.
